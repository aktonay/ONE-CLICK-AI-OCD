## Check Your Setup

Before installing, let's verify your system is ready.

### Windows

1. **Open PowerShell** (Press `Win + X`, select "Windows PowerShell")

2. **Check Python version:**
   ```powershell
   python --version
   ```
   You should see: `Python 3.11.x` or higher

3. **Check pip:**
   ```powershell
   pip --version
   ```
   You should see: `pip 23.x.x` or similar

### Ubuntu/Linux

1. **Open Terminal** (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`)

2. **Check Python version:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   You should see: `Python 3.11.x` or higher

3. **Check pip:**
   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```
   You should see: `pip 23.x.x` or similar

### macOS

1. **Open Terminal** (Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal")

2. **Check Python version:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   You should see: `Python 3.11.x` or higher

3. **Check pip:**
   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```
   You should see: `pip 23.x.x` or similar

## Troubleshooting Setup Issues

### Python Not Found

**Windows:**
- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- ✅ Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart your computer after installation

**Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3-pip
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

### pip Not Found

**All systems:**
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

## Understanding the Basics

### What Happens When You Run the Tool?

1. **You run a single command** with your preferences
2. **The tool generates** a complete project structure
3. **You get** ready-to-use code with:
   - API endpoints (using FastAPI)
   - Database connections
   - AI model integrations
   - Docker files
   - Tests and documentation

### Project Structure Overview

After generation, your project will look like this:

```
my-ai-project/
├── src/                    # Your main code
│   ├── api/               # API endpoints (HTTP routes)
│   ├── core/              # AI features (LLM, RAG, etc.)
│   ├── db/                # Database setup
│   └── main.py            # Application entry point
├── tests/                 # Automated tests
├── docker/                # Docker configuration
├── .github/               # CI/CD workflows
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### Key Concepts

**FastAPI**: A modern Python web framework for building APIs
- Think of it as the "waiter" that takes requests and serves responses

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI models like GPT-4, Claude
- The "brain" that generates human-like text

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: A technique to make AI use your data
- Combines your documents with AI's knowledge

**Vector Store**: A database for AI embeddings
- Helps AI "remember" and search your documents

**Docker**: A tool to package your app and all dependencies
- Makes your app run the same everywhere

## Common Questions

### "I've never coded before. Can I use this?"

Yes! This tool generates the code for you. You'll need to:
1. Run simple commands (we'll show you exactly what to type)
2. Edit configuration files (just change values like API keys)
3. Start the server (one command)

### "Do I need to know AI/ML?"

No! The tool handles the complex AI setup. You just:
- Choose which features you want
- Provide API keys (like passwords for AI services)
- Use the generated code

### "How much does this cost?"

- **One Click AI Spark**: FREE and open-source
- **AI APIs**: You'll need accounts with services like:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4): ~$0.03 per 1K tokens
  - Anthropic (Claude): ~$0.015 per 1K tokens
  - Many have free tiers to start!

### "Can I use this for my startup/business?"

Yes! It's MIT licensed - use it commercially, modify it, whatever you need.
